A /next browser/ mode for editing Jupyter Notebooks.

*NOTE:* This is largely a *WIP*, with features added on the fly as I find myself
 wanting them during my day to day work.

** Features to add
*** TODO Notebook buffer crashes on navigation away
*** TODO Should we use pre-defined =Jupyter= events?
    Currently, the up/down motion functions are re-implementations of JS events
    already available in the API; Should they just hook those events directly?
*** TODO /Visual-mode/ for multi-cell selection
*** TODO Shutdown kernel command
*** TODO More keybindings
**** TODO =y= to copy cell(s)
**** TODO =x= to cut cell(s)
**** TODO =P= to paste below, =p= to paste above
**** TODO =E= for ~edit-cell-metadata~
**** TODO =C-c C-c= for running cells
     If one or more cells are active, ~C-c C-c~ should run them. If no cells are
     active, it should run the entire document.
**** TODO Undo
**** TODO Redo
**** TODO Revert to checkpoint
*** TODO Switch-to-shell command (may require =Jupyter= package on Emacs)
*** TODO Start kernel command
